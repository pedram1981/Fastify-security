## Features

- User authentication with JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
- Password hashing with bcrypt
- Rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks
- CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) configuration
- Helmet middleware for security-related HTTP headers
- Environment variable management with dotenv-safe
- Error handling with Ajv-errors

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or later)
- MongoDB (v4 or later)
